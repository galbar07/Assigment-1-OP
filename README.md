# Assigment-2-OP
This program represent group of functions such as Monom,Polynom and Complex function,And let the user build this functions and draw them by using Java StDraw libary, This program lets you use mathematical opreations on this functions such as add,mult...


#                                             Monom :
 This class represents a monom in the form of ax^b where a is a real number and b is a natural number.

                                

# polynom :
This class represents a polynom which compose of monoms. 


 # ComplexFunctions:
This class represents complex function that can be composed of Monom,Polynom, and ComplexFunction.

Example
                       
                                                         div
		 *                           mul                            max
		 * 						       22x^3      53
		 *                  min               plus
		 *            3x^3       46      x^2       x^7
